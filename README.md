# NoBS Guitar Scales, Chords and Arpeggios - Android App

I'm a guitar player wannabe and I couldn't find a simplest app that's clear, without ads and .. free ,
so I made one myself. 

It's stupid simple, it just displays diagrams for guitar chords, scales and arpeggios.
Name stands for No Bullsh** 

There might be some errors in the diagrams as I made them all by hand, no fancy generators. 
If you spot any erros, let me know or fix it yourself if you are a developer. 

Reviews always helpful ! 

Enjoy!
